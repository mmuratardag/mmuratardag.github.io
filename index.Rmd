I am a data scientist and a political psychologist. I specialize in in psychometrics, psycholinguistics, cross-cultural research, and modeling subjectivity.
</div>

<div>
I have been coding in the R environment for > 7 years. I improved my coding skills in the Python environment after attending the [Spiced Academy's Data Science Bootcamp](https://www.spiced-academy.com/en/program/data-science){target="_blank"} in 2021.
</div>

<div>
In my previous academic job as a postdoc, I worked as the lead data analyst in a third-party funded project ([Business Finland](https://www.businessfinland.fi/en/){target="_blank"} & [Hofstede Insights](https://www.hofstede-insights.com/){target="_blank"}), developing a dictionary that measures organizational culture with [Hofstede's Multi-Focus Model](https://hi.hofstede-insights.com/multi-focus-model){target="_blank"}.
</div>

<div>
As a political psychologist[^1], my passion is revealing and understanding heterogeneity. That translates into various unsupervised machine learning and natural language processing applications like latent profile analysis, latent class analysis, psychological profiles with psychometric networks[^2], [semantic networks](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SemNeT/index.html){target="_blank"}, [concept class analysis](https://github.com/dustinstoltz/CMDist){target="_blank"}.
</div>

<div>
My work always involves one of the following. (1) machine learning & deep learning; (2) natural language processing; (3) the general structural equation modeling framework; (4) psychometric networks; (5) social network analysis. To generate new insights, I utilize my domain knowledge in data science, political science, and psychology.
</div>

<div>
Before academic life, I was a sales manager at a multi-national outdoor advertising company in Istanbul. During my undergrad studies, I worked as a music journalist.
