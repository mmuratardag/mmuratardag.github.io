I am a data scientist and a political psychologist.

I specialize in psychometrics, psycholinguistics, cross-cultural research, and modeling subjectivity. My work almost always involves one of the following. (1) machine learning & deep learning; (2) natural language processing; (3 ) the general structural equation modeling framework; (4) psychometric networks; (5) social network analysis. To generate new insights, I utilize my domain knowledge in diverse fields such as data science, political science, and psychology.
